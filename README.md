# Burmese-Python
Analysis with, data cleaning, web-scraping, forecasting and visualizations about the increase of Burmese Python in the wild.

## 0. Project Intro
Burmese Pythons is one of the largest species of snakes in the world, they are native from Southeast Asia; this specie is classified as an invasive species in the State of Florida, they are preying native species and competing with native species for food and other resources disrupting the ecosystem.
Over the past years, there has been a concern about the fast-growing of the species in Florida and the potential spread in other states; for this reason, the state of Florida started a "Python Elimination program".

## 1. Objectives:
As Data Analyst we can use our skills to help support this program, our main focuses are:

* Connect to SQLPro to import python.sql data.
* Clean and organize the data.
* Analyse historical data, looking for recurrences, and conduct patterns throughout the year in Florida.
* Recommend the best locations and time to go hunting the specie.
* Time-series analysis yo predict the sightings for the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020.
* Scrape of iNaturalist.
* Analyse website looking for the most active users and pick which one of these has the most connections (Network Analysis).
